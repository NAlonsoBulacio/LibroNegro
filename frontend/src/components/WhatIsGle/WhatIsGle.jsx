        <p>
          This cream is an everyday cream formulated for the face, neck,
          and decolletage. With a list of all-natural, high-quality
          ingredients it has never been easier to achieve the results that
          you need. You don’t need to use a lot each time. A little goes a
          long way and at the size of 4 oz per tube, this cream will last
          for quite a while. The science behind this product is simple.
          Combining ingredients like Algae Extract and Vitamins E, B3,
          &amp; B5 makes it suitable for all skin types even those that
          are acne-prone and allergy-prone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Algae Extract is the ocean’s secret and has been used in skin
          care for thousands of years. It has been proven to hydrate
          immensely. Skin that is more prone to dry will benefit the most.
          This is a great ingredient for any anti-aging cream due to all
          these benefits. Algae Extract is full of Vitamins A, B, C, and
          even E.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps to protect your cells
          from any damage.  When you apply a cream that is rich in vitamin
          E, you are moisturizing the skin and that moisture will prevent
          dry skin that makes your skin more prone to wrinkles when it's
          dried.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitamin B3 &amp; B5 When mixing these two powerhouse ingredients
          you will get the best of both worlds. Both are hydrating and
          suitable for sensitive skin and even skin that is acne-prone.
          Vitamin B3 acts as an antibacterial and will help reduce
          staining in the skin while B5 is hydrating and healing. Vitamin
          B5 will help improve skin’s elasticity as well as overall
          appearance. Vitamin B3 is most common for reducing the
          appearance of spots and redness in the skin and minimizing pore
          appearance, protecting against UV damage, reducing the
          appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, moisture and hydration,
          and even helping to treat acne.
