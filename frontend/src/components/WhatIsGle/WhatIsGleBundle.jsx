          WHY IS THE GLE BUNDLE SPECIAL?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-left">
          Our bundle is designed to take care of your beautiful skin during the
          day and during the night. The three products come with a face massager
          that will assist you to gently apply the products to your skin and
          ensure that our natural ingredients will be deeply absorbed. The Gle
          Bundle consists of an anti-aging cream that contains Vitamin E, B3,
          and B5. By using the product twice a day you will ensure your skin is
          well moisturized retaining its natural elasticity. The second product
          included in the bundle is a Gle Good Night - a night cream with
          Retinol that will gently pamper your face and neck cream during the
          night. No, we didn't forget about your eye serum! Gle for Dark Circles
          is going to be your best friend, ensuring a natural healthy glow with
          mind-blowing Caffeine and Vitamin C for your morning ritual around the
          eye area.
