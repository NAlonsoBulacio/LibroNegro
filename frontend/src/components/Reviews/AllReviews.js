      "Very luxurious feel with super quick absorption of my thirsty skin. I was really surprised when I saw the size of the tube. The packaging is fancy, and it came really fast! I am located in Canada, so I didn't expect such a fast delivery!",

      "This is my favorite face cream and as a result of using it consistently, my 66-year-old face looks like that of a 20-year-old...lol...just kidding, but it is a great product and my skin is in great shape because of it. The biggest plus is that it is half the price that I used to pay at Walmart. It‚Äôs a worthwhile product for certain!",

    review:
      "Huge change in the appearance and feel of my skin! Goodbye wrinkles and deep grooves. I bought this product along with an Olay product that was similarly rated 4 best over-the-counter wrinkle products. I alternated between them and tried both. Gle's product was clearly Superior. It goes on creamy and is almost instantly absorbed. After years of applying retinol based acids and moisturizers, this is the one that is finally doing the trick. My skin looks better than it has looked in probably the last 10 years. Friends even notice the difference in my skin and asked what I was using! I'm incredibly happy with this product and would recommend it to everyone. There is a slight tingling sensation when I put it on, but I have experienced no breakouts or redness or blotchiness.",

    review:
      "I like the consistency of the cream and a little goes a long way. There is a tingling sensation and be careful around your eyes. I also felt my wrinkles faded a little. I am 78 years old and have taken very good care of my skin and have good genes. I've used many products over the years. You really cannot turn back time unless you have plastic surgery( I haven't), but you can soften the appearance of some wrinkling if you stay out of the sun and keep your face moisturized. I believe this product has helped.",

      "This is a must-have cream if you are looking for a cream that beautifies the skin and doesn't cost a fortune. It works well even if you have sensitive skin. I think it's all about consistency and using the product daily. Once you make it part of your daily routine it's easier to see results.",

      "This product is unbelievable. I love it. Within about 3 days I could see a major difference. No wrinkles around my lips and eyes and my skin on my neck has tighten up also. I have tried everything and have spent hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. I will never be without this product. The picture above is from my 70th birthday party 2 weeks ago. People guess me to be between 45-50 years old. Don‚Äôt walk but run to get this product. I refused to have plastic surgery but wanted to age gracefully. My skin is so dewy and glows and is soft.",
